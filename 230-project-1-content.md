# *Amungus*

## High Concept

Consume the city and thwart the military's efforts to destroy you in this real-time strategy game.
---

## Genre

Amungus emphasizes quick thinking and proactive choices to provide a rewarding top-down real-time strategy experience.

## Platform

Amungus will be developed in Unity and deployed on this site in the HTML5 format. Following its completion for
the purposes of this project, it will also be deployed on itch.io in a downloadable format for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

## Story

You play as an infectious, gargantuan fungus that threatens the safety of a collection of cities built on an archipelago.
Your goal on each island-level is to cover a target amount of the city within a time limit while avoiding missiles,
troops, and airstrikes. Over the course of the game, the layouts of the cities will become more and more difficult to manage, 
and the resistance you encounter will become smarter and more resilient. Can you achieve your goal of consuming the entire
chain of islands? Or will you be contained by the population?

## Gameplay

### Mechanics and Controls.

The game uses the four directional keys as well as the Z key during play.

The area of play on each level is composed of a grid of tiles. The fungus begins each level as an occupant of a single tile.
The player can at any time select a tile which contains fungus and expand it in one of the four cardinal directions with respect to 
the grid layout. The player uses the directional keys to navigate a cursor to the area of fungus they wish to expand, presses the
Z key to select the area, and may then use the directional keys once more to expand the fungus. This is the simplest way the player
interacts with the game world.

Additionally, a player may retract an area of fungus back into itself by selecting an area with another fungus tile adjacent to it
and "expanding" it into the adjacent fungus tile. In this way, the player can leverage threats by physically avoiding certain tiles,
and even splitting itself into multiple chunks.

To clear a level, the fungus must cover a target number of city tiles on the island. When this goal is achieved, the next level is
unlocked for play. If the player does not cover the target area within a time limit, or the amount of fungus tiles in the map is 
reduced to 0, a lose state is prompted and the level must be retried.

Progression through the levels manifests with higher complexity of layouts, greater incidence of choke points and military resistance,
and greater area of tiles required to clear each level.

### Onboarding.

In the vein of progression, the first levels of Amungus are tailored specifically in the interest of providing a non-hostile environment
to facilitate the player's understanding of the game's basic mechanics before incorporating the time element or hostile entities. When a 
new mechanic is introduced, such as the ability of the fungus to split itself, or the different capabilities of the resitant forces, a level
will be present wherein that mechanic may be experimented with in isolation before being utilized in conjunction with any other mechanic.

### Player learning.

Over the course of the game, players must learn to cope with changing circumstances and accrue skill in maneuvering the fungus to budget time
as effectively as possible. They must learn to adaptively apply knowledge of individual mechanics and interactions simultaneously.
